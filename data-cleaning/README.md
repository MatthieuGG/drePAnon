# Data cleaning

The first step in the project is the data cleaning. We have 4 types of data:
- Physical Activity, obtained through Fitbit trackers. It consists in minute, hour or daily data such as the number of steps or calories. They need some cleaning, to be sure that the dates and values are correct.
- Clinical events, obtained through questionnaires filed daily. We then have information about pain, bedrest, hospitalisation, etc. We need some cleaning, to make sure that the dates and values are correct, and to create some filters.
- GPAQ. This questionnaire permits to evaluate the MET-min/week in different activities. We make sure that the values are correct, and make the category transformation.
- SF36. This questionnaire permits to evaluate the quality of life. We make sure that the values are correct, and make the category transformation.
